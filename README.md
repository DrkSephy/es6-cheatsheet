## var versus let / const

> Besides `var`, we now have access to two new identifiers for storing values
—`let` and `const`. Unlike `var`, `let` and `const` statements are not hoisted
to the top of their enclosing scope.

An example of using `var`:

```javascript
var snack = 'Meow Mix';

function getFood(food) {
    if (food) {
        var snack = 'Friskies';
        return snack;
    }
    return snack;
}

getFood(false); // undefined
```

However, observe what happens when we replace `var` using `let`:

```javascript
let snack = 'Meow Mix';

function getFood(food) {
    if (food) {
        let snack = 'Friskies';
        return snack;
    }
    return snack;
}

getFood(false); // 'Meow Mix'
```

This change in behavior highlights that we need to be careful when refactoring
legacy code which uses `var`. Blindly replacing instances of `var` with `let`
may lead to unexpected behavior.

> **Note**: `let` and `const` are block scoped. Therefore, referencing
block-scoped identifiers before they are defined will produce
a `ReferenceError`.

```javascript
console.log(x);

let x = 'hi'; // ReferenceError: x is not defined
```

> **Best Practice**: Leave `var` declarations inside of legacy code to denote
that it needs to be carefully refactored. When working on a new codebase, use
`let` for variables that will change their value over time, and `const` for
variables which cannot be reassigned.

## Replacing IIFEs with Blocks

> A common use of **Immediately Invoked Function Expressions** is to enclose
values within its scope. In ES6, we now have the ability to create block-based
scopes and therefore are not limited purely to function-based scope.

```javascript
(function () {
    var food = 'Meow Mix';
}());

console.log(food); // Reference Error
```

Using ES6 Blocks:

```javascript
{
    let food = 'Meow Mix';
}

console.log(food); // Reference Error
```

## Arrow Functions

Often times we have nested functions in which we would like to preserve the
context of `this` from its lexical scope. An example is shown below:

```javascript
function Person(name) {
    this.name = name;
}

Person.prototype.prefixName = function (arr) {
    return arr.map(function (character) {
        return this.name + character; // Cannot read property 'name' of undefined
    });
};
```

One common solution to this problem is to store the context of `this` using
a variable:

```javascript
function Person(name) {
    this.name = name;
}

Person.prototype.prefixName = function (arr) {
    var that = this; // Store the context of this
    return arr.map(function (character) {
        return that.name + character;
    });
};
```

We can also pass in the proper context of `this`:

```javascript
function Person(name) {
    this.name = name;
}

Person.prototype.prefixName = function (arr) {
    return arr.map(function (character) {
        return this.name + character;
    }, this);
};
```

As well as bind the context:

```javascript
function Person(name) {
    this.name = name;
}

Person.prototype.prefixName = function (arr) {
    return arr.map(function (character) {
        return this.name + character;
    }.bind(this));
};
```

Using **Arrow Functions**, the lexical value of `this` isn't shadowed and we
can re-write the above as shown:

```javascript
function Person(name) {
    this.name = name;
}

Person.prototype.prefixName = function (arr) {
    return arr.map(character => this.name + character);
};
```

> **Best Practice**: Use **Arrow Functions** whenever you need to preserve the
lexical value of `this`.

Arrow Functions are also more concise when used in function expressions which
simply return a value:

```javascript
var squares = arr.map(function (x) { return x * x }); // Function Expression
```

```javascript
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const squares = arr.map(x => x * x); // Arrow Function for terser implementation
```

> **Best Practice**: Use **Arrow Functions** in place of function expressions
when possible.

## Strings

With ES6, the standard library has grown immensely. Along with these changes
are new methods which can be used on strings, such as `.includes()` and
`.repeat()`.

### .includes( )

```javascript
var string = 'food';
var substring = 'foo';

console.log(string.indexOf(substring) > -1);
```

Instead of checking for a return value `> -1` to denote string containment,
we can simply use `.includes()` which will return a boolean:

```javascript
const string = 'food';
const substring = 'foo';

console.log(string.includes(substring)); // true
```

### .repeat( )

```javascript
function repeat(string, count) {
    var strings = [];
    while(strings.length < count) {
        strings.push(string);
    }
    return strings.join('');
}
```

In ES6, we now have access to a terser implementation:

```javascript
// String.repeat(numberOfRepetitions)
'meow'.repeat(3); // 'meowmeowmeow'
```

### Template Literals

Using **Template Literals**, we can now construct strings that have special
characters in them without needing to escape them explicitly.

```javascript
var text = "This string contains \"double quotes\" which are escaped.";
```

```javascript
let text = `This string contains "double quotes" which are escaped.`;
```

**Template Literals** also support interpolation, which makes the task of
concatenating strings and values:

```javascript
var name = 'Tiger';
var age = 13;

console.log('My cat is named ' + name + ' and is ' + age + ' years old.');
```

Much simpler:

```javascript
const name = 'Tiger';
const age = 13;

console.log(`My cat is named ${name} and is ${age} years old.`);
```

In ES5, we handled new lines as follows:

```javascript
var text = (
    'cat\n' +
    'dog\n' +
    'nickelodeon'
);
```

Or:

```javascript
var text = [
    'cat',
    'dog',
    'nickelodeon'
].join('\n');
```

**Template Literals** will preserve new lines for us without having to
explicitly place them in:

```javascript
let text = ( `cat
dog
nickelodeon`
);
```

**Template Literals** can accept expressions, as well:

```javascript
let today = new Date();
let text = `The time and date is ${today.toLocaleString()}`;
```

## Destructuring

Destructuring allows us to extract values from arrays and objects (even deeply
nested) and store them in variables with a more convenient syntax.

### Destructuring Arrays

```javascript
var arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];
var a = arr[0];
var b = arr[1];
var c = arr[2];
var d = arr[3];
```

```javascript
let [a, b, c, d] = [1, 2, 3, 4];

console.log(a); // 1
console.log(b); // 2
```

### Destructuring Objects

```javascript
var luke = { occupation: 'jedi', father: 'anakin' };
var occupation = luke.occupation; // 'jedi'
var father = luke.father; // 'anakin'
```

```javascript
let luke = { occupation: 'jedi', father: 'anakin' };
let {occupation, father} = luke;

console.log(occupation); // 'jedi'
console.log(father); // 'anakin'
```

<sup>[(back to table of contents)](#table-of-contents)</sup>

## Modules

Prior to ES6, we used libraries such as [Browserify](http://browserify.org/)
to create modules on the client-side, and [require](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_module_require_id)
in **Node.js**. With ES6, we can now directly use modules of all types
(AMD and CommonJS).

### Exporting in CommonJS

```javascript
module.exports = 1;
module.exports = { foo: 'bar' };
module.exports = ['foo', 'bar'];
module.exports = function bar () {};
```

### Exporting in ES6

With ES6, we have various flavors of exporting. We can perform
**Named Exports**:

```javascript
export let name = 'David';
export let age  = 25;​​
```

As well as **exporting a list** of objects:

```javascript
function sumTwo(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}

function sumThree(a, b, c) {
    return a + b + c;
}

export { sumTwo, sumThree };
```

We can also export a value simply by using the `export` keyword:

```javascript
export function sumTwo(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}

export function sumThree(a, b, c) {
    return a + b + c;
}
```

And lastly, we can **export default bindings**:

```javascript
function sumTwo(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}

function sumThree(a, b, c) {
    return a + b + c;
}

let api = {
    sumTwo,
    sumThree
};

export default api;
```

> **Best Practices**: Always use the `export default` method at **the end** of
the module. It makes it clear what is being exported, and saves time by having
to figure out what name a value was exported as. More so, the common practice
in CommonJS modules is to export a single value or object. By sticking to this
paradigm, we make our code easily readable and allow ourselves to interpolate
between CommonJS and ES6 modules.

### Importing in ES6

ES6 provides us with various flavors of importing. We can import an entire file:

```javascript
import 'underscore';
```

> It is important to note that simply **importing an entire file will execute
all code at the top level of that file**.

Similar to Python, we have named imports:

```javascript
import { sumTwo, sumThree } from 'math/addition';
```

We can also rename the named imports:

```javascript
import {
    sumTwo as addTwoNumbers,
    sumThree as sumThreeNumbers
} from 'math/addition';
```

In addition, we can **import all the things** (also called namespace import):

```javascript
import * as util from 'math/addition';
```

Lastly, we can import a list of values from a module:

```javascript
import * as additionUtil from 'math/addition';
const { sumTwo, sumThree } = additionUtil;
```

When importing the default object we can choose which functions to import:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
const { Component, PropTypes } = React;
```

This can also be simplified further, using:

```javascript
import React, { Component, PropTypes } from 'react';
```

> **Note**: Values that are exported are **bindings**, not references.
Therefore, changing the binding of a variable in one module will affect the
value within the exported module. Avoid changing the public interface of these
exported values.

## Parameters

In ES5, we had varying ways to handle functions which needed **default values**,
**indefinite arguments**, and **named parameters**. With ES6, we can accomplish
all of this and more using more concise syntax.

### Default Parameters

```javascript
function addTwoNumbers(x, y) {
    x = x || 0;
    y = y || 0;
    return x + y;
}
```

In ES6, we can simply supply default values for parameters in a function:

```javascript
function addTwoNumbers(x=0, y=0) {
    return x + y;
}
```

```javascript
addTwoNumbers(2, 4); // 6
addTwoNumbers(2); // 2
addTwoNumbers(); // 0
```

### Rest Parameters

In ES5, we handled an indefinite number of arguments like so:

```javascript
function logArguments() {
    for (var i=0; i < arguments.length; i++) {
        console.log(arguments[i]);
    }
}
```

Using the **rest** operator, we can pass in an indefinite amount of arguments:

```javascript
function logArguments(...args) {
    for (let arg of args) {
        console.log(arg);
    }
}
```

### Named Parameters

One of the patterns in ES5 to handle named parameters was to use the **options
object** pattern, adopted from jQuery.

```javascript
function initializeCanvas(options) {
    var height = options.height || 600;
    var width  = options.width  || 400;
    var lineStroke = options.lineStroke || 'black';
}
```

We can achieve the same functionality using destructuring as a formal parameter
to a function:

```javascript
function initializeCanvas(
    { height=600, width=400, lineStroke='black'}) {
        // Use variables height, width, lineStroke here
    }
```

If we want to make the entire value optional, we can do so by destructuring an
empty object:

```javascript
function initializeCanvas(
    { height=600, width=400, lineStroke='black'} = {}) {
        // ...
    }
```

### Spread Operator

We can use the spread operator to pass an array of values to be used as
parameters to a function:

```javascript
Math.max(...[-1, 100, 9001, -32]); // 9001
```

<sup>[(back to table of contents)](#table-of-contents)</sup>

## Classes

Prior to ES6, we implemented Classes by creating a constructor function and
adding properties by extending the prototype:

```javascript
function Person(name, age, gender) {
    this.name   = name;
    this.age    = age;
    this.gender = gender;
}

Person.prototype.incrementAge = function () {
    return this.age += 1;
};
```

And created extended classes by the following:

```javascript
function Personal(name, age, gender, occupation, hobby) {
    Person.call(this, name, age, gender);
    this.occupation = occupation;
    this.hobby = hobby;
}

Personal.prototype = Object.create(Person.prototype);
Personal.prototype.constructor = Personal;
Personal.prototype.incrementAge = function () {
    return Person.prototype.incrementAge.call(this) += 20;
};
```

ES6 provides much needed syntactic sugar for doing this under the hood. We can
create Classes directly:

```javascript
class Person {
    constructor(name, age, gender) {
        this.name   = name;
        this.age    = age;
        this.gender = gender;
    }

    incrementAge() {
      this.age += 1;
    }
}
```

And extend them using the `extends` keyword:

```javascript
class Personal extends Person {
    constructor(name, age, gender, occupation, hobby) {
        super(name, age, gender);
        this.occupation = occupation;
        this.hobby = hobby;
    }

    incrementAge() {
        super.incrementAge();
        this.age += 20;
        console.log(this.age);
    }
}
```

> **Best Practice**: While the syntax for creating classes in ES6 obscures how
implementation and prototypes work under the hood, it is a good feature for
beginners and allows us to write cleaner code.

<sup>[(back to table of contents)](#table-of-contents)</sup>

## Symbols

Symbols have existed prior to ES6, but now we have a public interface to using
them directly. Symbols are immutable and unique and can be used as keys in any hash.

### Symbol( )

Calling `Symbol()` or `Symbol(description)` will create a unique symbol that cannot be looked up
globally. A Use case for `Symbol()` is to patch objects or namespaces from third parties with your own
logic, but be confident that you won't collide with updates to that library. For example,
if you wanted to add a method `refreshComponent` to the `React.Component` class, and be certain that
you didn't trample a method they add in a later update:

```javascript
const refreshComponent = Symbol();

React.Component.prototype[refreshComponent] = () => {
    // do something
}
```


### Symbol.for(key)

`Symbol.for(key)` will create a Symbol that is still immutable and unique, but can be looked up globally.
Two identical calls to `Symbol.for(key)` will return the same Symbol instance. NOTE: This is not true for 
`Symbol(description)`:

```javascript
Symbol('foo') === Symbol('foo') // false
Symbol.for('foo') === Symbol('foo') // false
Symbol.for('foo') === Symbol.for('foo') // true
```

A common use case for Symbols, and in particular with `Symbol.for(key)` is for interoperability. This can be 
acheived by having your code look for a Symbol member on object arguments from third parties that contain some 
known interface. For example:

```javascript
function reader(obj) {
    const specialRead = Symbol.for('specialRead');
    if (obj[specialRead]) {
        const reader = obj[specialRead]();
        // do something with reader
    } else {
        throw new TypeError('object cannot be read');
    }
}
```

And then in another library:

```javascript
const specialRead = Symbol.for('specialRead');

class SomeReadableType {
    [specialRead]() {
        const reader = createSomeReaderFrom(this);
        return reader;
    }
}
```

> A notable example of Symbol use for interoperability is `Symbol.iterable` which exists on all iterable and iterator
types in ES6: Arrays, strings, generators, etc. When called as a method it returns an object with an Iterator 
interface.

<sup>[(back to table of contents)](#table-of-contents)</sup>

## Maps

**Maps** is a much needed data structure in JavaScript. Prior to ES6, we created
**hash** maps through objects:

```javascript
var map = new Object();
map[key1] = 'value1';
map[key2] = 'value2';
```

However, this does not protect us from accidentally overriding functions with
specific property names:

```javascript
> getOwnProperty({ hasOwnProperty: 'Hah, overwritten'}, 'Pwned');
> TypeError: Property 'hasOwnProperty' is not a function
```

Actual **Maps** allow us to `set`, `get` and `search` for values (and much more).

```javascript
let map = new Map();
> map.set('name', 'david');
> map.get('name'); // david
> map.has('name'); // true
```

The most amazing part of Maps is that we are no longer limited to just using
strings. We can now use any type as a key, and it will not be type-casted to
a string.

```javascript
let map = new Map([
    ['name', 'david'],
    [true, 'false'],
    [1, 'one'],
    [{}, 'object'],
    [function () {}, 'function']
]);

for (let key of map.keys()) {
    console.log(typeof key);
    // > string, boolean, number, object, function
}
```

> **Note**: Using non-primitive values such as functions or objects won't work
when testing equality using methods such as `map.get()`. As such, stick to
primitive values such as Strings, Booleans and Numbers.

We can also iterate over maps using `.entries()`:

```javascript
for (let [key, value] of map.entries()) {
    console.log(key, value);
}
```

<sup>[(back to table of contents)](#table-of-contents)</sup>

## WeakMaps

In order to store private data in < ES5, we had various ways of doing this.
One such method was using naming conventions:

```javascript
class Person {
    constructor(age) {
        this._age = age;
    }

    _incrementAge() {
        this._age += 1;
    }
}
```

But naming conventions can cause confusion in a codebase and are not always
going to be upheld. Instead, we can use WeakMaps to store our values:

```javascript
let _age = new WeakMap();
class Person {
    constructor(age) {
        _age.set(this, age);
    }

    incrementAge() {
        let age = _age.get(this) + 1;
        _age.set(this, age);
        if (age > 50) {
            console.log('Midlife crisis');
        }
    }
}
```

The cool thing about using WeakMaps to store our private data is that their
keys do not give away the property names, which can be seen by using
`Reflect.ownKeys()`:

```javascript
> const person = new Person(50);
> person.incrementAge(); // 'Midlife crisis'
> Reflect.ownKeys(person); // []
```

A more practical example of using WeakMaps is to store data which is associated
to a DOM element without having to pollute the DOM itself:

```javascript
let map = new WeakMap();
let el  = document.getElementById('someElement');

// Store a weak reference to the element with a key
map.set(el, 'reference');

// Access the value of the element
let value = map.get(el); // 'reference'

// Remove the reference
el.parentNode.removeChild(el);
el = null;

value = map.get(el); // undefined
```

As shown above, once the object is is destroyed by the garbage collector,
the WeakMap will automatically remove the key-value pair which was identified
by that object.

> **Note**: To further illustrate the usefulness of this example, consider how
jQuery stores a cache of objects corresponding to DOM elements which have
references. Using WeakMaps, jQuery can automatically free up any memory that
was associated with a particular DOM element once it has been removed from the
document. In general, WeakMaps are very useful for any library that wraps DOM
elements.

<sup>[(back to table of contents)](#table-of-contents)</sup>

## Promises

Promises allow us to turn our horizontal code (callback hell):

```javascript
func1(function (value1) {
    func2(value1, function (value2) {
        func3(value2, function (value3) {
            func4(value3, function (value4) {
                func5(value4, function (value5) {
                    // Do something with value 5
                });
            });
        });
    });
});
```

Into vertical code:

```javascript
func1(value1)
    .then(func2)
    .then(func3)
    .then(func4)
    .then(func5, value5 => {
        // Do something with value 5
    });
```

Prior to ES6, we used [bluebird](https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird) or
[Q](https://github.com/kriskowal/q). Now we have Promises natively:

```javascript
new Promise((resolve, reject) =>
    reject(new Error('Failed to fulfill Promise')))
        .catch(reason => console.log(reason));
```

Where we have two handlers, **resolve** (a function called when the Promise is
**fulfilled**) and **reject** (a function called when the Promise is **rejected**).

> **Benefits of Promises**: Error Handling using a bunch of nested callbacks
can get chaotic. Using Promises, we have a clear path to bubbling errors up
and handling them appropriately. Moreover, the value of a Promise after it has
been resolved/rejected is immutable - it will never change.

Here is a practical example of using Promises:

```javascript
var fetchJSON = function(url) {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        $.getJSON(url)
            .done((json) => resolve(json))
            .fail((xhr, status, err) => reject(status + err.message));
    });
};
```

We can also **parallelize** Promises to handle an array of asynchronous
operations by using `Promise.all()`:

```javascript
var urls = [
    'http://www.api.com/items/1234',
    'http://www.api.com/items/4567'
];

var urlPromises = urls.map(fetchJSON);

Promise.all(urlPromises)
    .then(function (results) {
        results.forEach(function (data) {
        });
    })
    .catch(function (err) {
        console.log('Failed: ', err);
    });
```
